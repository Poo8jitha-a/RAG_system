{"text": "Caledon Institute of Social Policy     1\nWhat is Policy?\nThere is no simple answer to this question\nPerhaps that is why so many people claim to have little or no understanding of policy.  In\nfact, many would say that they donât âdo policy.â  Others maintain that it has only minor\nrelevance to their work â or, for that matter, their lives.\nNot so.  We literally eat, drink and breathe public policy.\nPublic policy determines the quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink.  It\naffects the food we eat â how it is harvested, where it is distributed and sold, and how much we\npay.  It controls the way in which we clean and monitor (or not in the case of the Walkerton\ntragedy) the safety of the water supply."}

Public policy sets limits on air emissions â though, of\nlate, governments seem to be issuing warnings of poor air quality more than doing anything\nsignificant to clean it up.\nTransportation is another example of a domain governed by a variety of public policies,\nmost of which are concerned with the safety of travellers.  Public policy also regulates the\npublic airwaves by way of licensing and other rules (the licensing for satellite radio is a hot\ntopic at the moment).

Substantive and administrative policy\n Early in these structured policy conversations, it became clear that there are several\ndifferent kinds of policy.  The first is concerned with the legislation, programs and practices that\ngovern the substantive aspects of community work.  This dimension of policy includes, for\nexample, income security, employment initiatives, child care services and social exclusion.\nThe second type of policy focuses largely upon administrative procedures.  These\ninvolve, for instance, the collection of statistical information on neighbourhoods and the\nevaluation of complex community programs.\nb."}
{"text": "stance, the collection of statistical information on neighbourhoods and the\nevaluation of complex community programs.\nb. Vertical and horizontal policy\nSubstantive and administrative policy can be further classified as vertical or horizontal\npolicy.  The former refers to policy that is developed within the organization that has\nresponsibility for its implementation.\nVertical policy is what we think of as the normal or traditional way in which policy decisions are made.\nVertical policy is developed within a single organizational structure and generally starts with broad\noverarching policy, sometimes called âcorporateâ or âframeworkâ policy.  Such decisions are made at\nhead office and guide subsequent decisions throughout the organization."}
{"text": "âframeworkâ policy.  Such decisions are made at\nhead office and guide subsequent decisions throughout the organization.  At the regional level we might\ndevelop regional or âstrategicâ policy, which translates the national decisions to the regional level, taking\ninto consideration the specific context.  Finally, the regional policy is made specific enough to guide\noperational decision-making [Smith 2003: 11].\nHorizontal policy-making, by contrast, is developed by two or more organizations, each\nof which has the ability or mandate to deal with only one dimension of a given situation.\nHorizontal or integrated policy is created between parts of an organization or among\norganizational components that are similar in hierarchical position [Smith 2003: 11-12]."}

A formal process to amend or improve\nthe existing arrangement generally is in place.\nIf an issue is not currently or never has been âaliveâ on the public agenda, then there is\nwork to be done in making the case for its importance and raising awareness about the\nimplications of non-response.  Making the case usually involves gathering evidence that\nsupports the policy."}

{"text": "4     Caledon Institute of Social Policy\nPublic policy has a clear and unique purpose\nPolicy is a broad concept that embodies several different dimensions.  The challenge is\nto articulate in a comprehensible and cogent way the meaning of this term.\nIn a nutshell, public policy seeks to achieve a desired goal that is considered to be in the\nbest interest of all members of society.  Examples include clean air, clean water, good health,\nhigh employment, an innovative economy, active trade, high educational attainment, decent and\naffordable housing, minimal levels of poverty, improved literacy, low crime and a socially\ncohesive society, to name a few.\nThese examples of broad societal goals are not intended to imply that all public policies\nare directed toward the entire population."}
{"text": "es of broad societal goals are not intended to imply that all public policies\nare directed toward the entire population.  Sometimes policies deemed to promote the public\ninterest target only a certain group.  Crime prevention policies are in place, for instance, to\ncontrol the behaviour of repeat offenders.  Public health policies may require the forced\ntreatment of individuals with active tuberculosis.  The intent of these public policies is to\nprotect all members of society by focusing upon a select few.\nPolicy development is a decision-making process\nA public policy is a deliberate and (usually) careful decision that provides guidance for\naddressing selected public concerns."}
{"text": "ic policy is a deliberate and (usually) careful decision that provides guidance for\naddressing selected public concerns.  Policy development can be seen, then, as a decision-\nmaking process that helps address identified goals, problems or concerns.  At its core, policy\ndevelopment entails the selection of a destination or desired objective.\nThe actual formulation of policy involves the identification and analysis of a range of\nactions that respond to these concerns.  Each possible solution is assessed against a number of\nfactors such as probable effectiveness, potential cost, resources required for implementation,\npolitical context and community support.\nIn short, any given policy represents the end result of a decision as to how best to\nachieve a specific objective."}

{"text": "8     Caledon Institute of Social Policy\nThe first step in policy formulation is to determine the desired objective.  Policy directives can\nbe understood as an expression of commonly accepted societal values                      â e.g., fairness and\nequity are often cited as strong Canadian values.  Public policy is basically shaped by and must be\nconsistent with these values.\n Within this context, the selection of objectives typically derives from priorities and\nimperatives set at the political level.  The desired objective may be rooted in the platform of a\npolitical party or approved at its policy conference.  A policy direction may be announced, for\nexample, in the Speech from the Throne that opens a new Parliamentary session or in the\nfederal Budget."}
{"text": "e announced, for\nexample, in the Speech from the Throne that opens a new Parliamentary session or in the\nfederal Budget.  It may be signaled in a ministerial or departmental announcement regarding the\ngovernmentâs intended agenda in a certain area, such as promoting skills and learning,\nreforming the income security system, supporting a bio-based economy or investing in\nenvironmentally clean technologies.\nPolicy objectives can also arise from negotiations with provinces/territories and\nsubsequent intergovernmental agreements that effectively incorporate an explicit or implicit\nagenda.  For instance, the framework agreements on early childhood development, discussed\nbelow, form the foundation for work in this area."}
{"text": "ce, the framework agreements on early childhood development, discussed\nbelow, form the foundation for work in this area.\nPolicy directives derive as well from obligations, such as international covenants, to\nwhich Canada has made a commitment.  Canada is a signatory, for example, to the UN\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), the International Covenant on Economic,\nSocial and Cultural Rights (1966) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n(1966).  Through their signatures, nations commit themselves to bring legislation, policies and\npractices into line with these obligations.  These documents, at least in theory, are supposed to\nact as drivers, though action often lags far behind."}
{"text": "obligations.  These documents, at least in theory, are supposed to\nact as drivers, though action often lags far behind.\nInternational trade agreements represent another form of commitment with which\nnational policy is supposed to line up.  These have resulted in major shifts in the economy and\nassociated policies in respect of these agreements â many of which have not worked in Canadaâs\nfavour in recent years (read âsoftwood lumberâ).\nPolicy directives also arise from a range of driving forces that have a social, environ-\nmental or economic impact."}

Another is to ensure that various income security programs deliver benefits that are\nhigher than poverty levels and that households potentially eligible for these programs are aware\nof their existence.\nThese possible measures in respect of a specified policy objective â reducing poverty â\nare intended to illustrate a general point.

But the political waters have been muddied through federal involvement in health,\neducation, welfare and social services arising from its constitutional spending power.\nIn addition, municipalities are playing an increasingly important role in the Canadian\npolitical landscape.  In 2005, for example, the federal Budget announced a new Deal for Cities\nand Communities.  It builds on the agreement introduced in the 2004 Budget, which afforded a\nfull rebate on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the federal portion of the harmonized\nsales tax for municipalities."}
{"text": "full rebate on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the federal portion of the harmonized\nsales tax for municipalities.  The new Budget will deliver more than $7 billion to municipalities\nover ten years to help fund infrastructure priorities such as roads, sewers, transit and clean\nwater.  These funds are essential in order to repair, replace and upgrade aging municipal hard-\nware.\nThis jurisdictional divide means that any given policy area involves a range of actors\nwhose various interventions ideally should fit together into a coherent package.  The problem is\nthat these pieces often contradict one another.  Sometimes benefits delivered by one level of\ngovernment are offset by another â thereby nullifying their effect."}
{"text": "other.  Sometimes benefits delivered by one level of\ngovernment are offset by another â thereby nullifying their effect.\nIn 1978, for example, the federal government introduced the refundable child tax credit,\nto provide additional assistance to low-  and middle-income families.  Rather than passing\nalong the increase to welfare recipients, a municipality in one jurisdiction decided to reduce its\nwelfare benefits by an equivalent amount.  Instead of improving their circumstances, social\nassistance recipients would have been left in the same position as before.\nBut the problem goes both ways.  Sometimes the federal government negates the impact\nof a provincial benefit."}
{"text": "as before.\nBut the problem goes both ways.  Sometimes the federal government negates the impact\nof a provincial benefit.  For instance, provinces increasingly are exploring the option of\nindividualized funding in order to help persons with disabilities and their families purchase\nrequired supports.  The value of this approach is that it allows a customized response to a\nunique set of needs.  No two persons with disabilities are alike in their circumstances.\nA lump sum of cash is paid to individuals in respect of their identified needs for both\nincome and disability supports.  But the allowance provided for supports, in particular, is not\nintended for the purchase of food or shelter."}
